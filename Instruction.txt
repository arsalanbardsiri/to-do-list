Blueprint:

HTML structure:

Create a container element for the todo app.
Add a heading for the todo list.
Create a form with an input field and a button for adding tasks.
Create an empty unordered list for displaying tasks.

CSS styling:

Apply appropriate styles to the container, heading, form, and list elements.
Design the layout, colors, and typography according to your preference.

JavaScript functionality:

Create a Task class with properties such as ID, title, and status.
Initialize an empty array to store tasks.
Implement a function to add a new task to the array.
Implement a function to update an existing task in the array.
Implement a function to delete a task from the array.
Generate a unique ID for each task using a suitable method.
Render the tasks dynamically in the HTML by updating the task list.

Step-by-step guidance:

Set up the HTML structure:

Create a container element using <div> and give it an ID.
Add a heading element (e.g., <h1>Todo List</h1>) inside the container.
Create a form element using <form> and give it an ID.
Inside the form, add an input field (e.g., <input type="text">) and a button (e.g., <button type="submit">Add</button>).
Create an unordered list element using <ul> and give it an ID to represent the task list.

Apply CSS styling:

Add styles to the container element to define its dimensions, background, padding, etc.
Style the heading element with appropriate font size, color, and alignment.
Apply styles to the form element, input field, and button to achieve a visually pleasing design.
Customize the styles of the unordered list to control the appearance of the task list.

Set up JavaScript functionality:

Create a class called Task with properties like ID, title, and status.
Initialize an empty array to store tasks.
Implement a function to add a new task to the tasks array.
Implement a function to update the title or status of an existing task.
Implement a function to remove a task from the array.
Generate a unique ID for each task using a suitable method (e.g., timestamp).
Create a function to render the tasks dynamically in the HTML by updating the task list.

Add event listeners and interactions:

Attach an event listener to the form submission event.
Retrieve the task input value and pass it to the function for adding a new task.
Clear the input field after adding a task.
Implement event listeners for any interactions like editing or deleting a task.
Prompt the user for the updated title and pass it to the function for updating the task.
Remove the task from the array when the user chooses to delete it.
By following these steps and guidelines, you can create a Todo List Manager with full CRUD functionality. Remember to fill in the missing parts and add the necessary code logic within each function.
